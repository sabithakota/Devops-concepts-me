 docker node update --availability drain worker
12.To join worker into swarm
 docker node update --availability active worker
13.To make worker node as manager (promoting)
 docker node promote worker
14.To make workernode tookback as worker status
 docker node demote worker
15.worker selfleave go in to the worker machine
 docker swarm leave
16.To join node as worker in swarm (in manager machine)

1.To sse the user who is logged in
 whoami
2.To see tge list of usesr logged into the linux server
 who
3.To see the home directory of the current user
 echo $HOME
4.To create empty files 
 touch file1 file2 file3
 Note:touch will create empty files but create time stamps of the file
5.To create files that can store data
 cat >filename
ENter some data
To come  out of cat ctr+d
6.To display the content of file
cat filename
7.To append data to the existin file
 cat >> filename
8.To see the list of files in pwd
 ls =list of files
 ls -l =to see log listing of files(more details of files)
 ls -a = To see all hidden files and folders
 ls -lh =To see the file sizes in human readable formate
 ls -lt =To see the fiels information based on their timestamps
 ls -ltr =To see reverse the timestamp of the files
 ls -li =To see the inode numbers of files
 ls -ld =To see the metadata of directory
9.To create directories
 mkdir dirname
10.To create mutiple dirctories on within other
 mkdir -p d1/d2/d3/d4
11.To delete an empty directories 
 rmdir dirname
12.To delete a directory with files and folders
 rm -r dirname
13.To change directories 
 cd path_of_directroy
 . represent current directory so cd . will put the control 
in the present working directory only
 .. represents parent directroy so cd .. wiil put the control
to the parent of the curretn directory
 cd and cd~ will take the control to the home directroy of the current user
14.To copy files
 cp srcfile destfile
 If the destfile is already present cp will overwrite that file
 If the destfile is not presetn cp will create the new file
 To copy the directories
 cp -r srcdire destdir
 To copy the files and also preserve the time stamps 
 cp -p srcfile destfile
15.To move files(cut paste)
 mv srcfile destfile
 mv workrs like rename when the destination is the same directory
 mv works like cut paste wen the  destination is a different directory
16.Linking 
 This is 2 types a)Soft link b) Hard link
 a)Soft link is similat to s shortcut,it is used for easy access of data
 But if the original file is deleted the soft link files is of not ise
 ln -s srcfile destfile
 b)Hard link is file which has the same inode number as the original file 
even when the original file is deleted we can still access the data using 
hard link file 
 ln srcfile destfile
 If we run ls -li we can see that both  the srcfile detfile have the same 
inode numbers,whatever changes are done in the srcfile will be immediately reflected 
to the destfile

Text processing Tools:
========================
less:This is used to display the content of the file in pagewise fashion
     where we can navigate up and down using the arrow keys
	To comeout of less q
  	less filename
head:This is used to display the top 10 lines of file
	head filename
   To display only top 3 lines of the file
 	head -3 filename
tail:This is used to display the lst 10 lines of file
	tail filename
  To display last 5 lines of file
	tail -5 filename
grep: This is used to search for specific string and display all those 
      lines where the string is present
     To search for a word called "spool" in /etc/passwd file
	grep spool /etc/passwd
     To search for "Spool" without taking the upper/lowercase into considaration
	grep -i spool /etc/passwd
     To search for the work spool and also display line numbers
	grep -n spool /etc/passwd
     To search for all the lines where the word spool is not present
	grep -v spool /etc/passwd
cut:This is used to display the data in column fasion
    To display only 1st and 7th column from /etc/passwd file
	cut -d ":" -f 1,7 /etc/passwd
wc:used to count the number of lines,words and chars in file
	wc filename
       To display only no of lines in file
	wc -l filename
       To display only no words in file
	wc -w filename
       To display only chars in file
	wc -c filename
sort:Usd to sort the content of file
	sort fielname
Not: sort by defauly performs an alphabet sort
    To pserform a numerical sort
      sort -n filename
    To perform a reverse numerical sort
	sort -nr filename

Redirection:
==============
send the output,error and both into a file is called redirection
we have 3 types of redirection
1)Output redirection
 To send the output of ls -la into file1
	ls -la > file1
 To send the output of multiple commands
	(date;cal) > file1
2)Error redirection
 To send the error msg of the below mkdir command in file2
	mkdir d1/d2/d3/d4 2> file2

3)Both redirection
 To redirect both error and output we can use &>
 (data;cal) &> file3

Piping
=========
Send the output of a command as input for some other command is called 
piping
1.To count the no of lines displayed when ls -la is executed
  we can first store in file using redirection an count using wc -l
 we can use pipeng
 ls -la file1 | wc -l
2.To capture only 5th line from /etc/passwd file
  head -5 /etc/passw | tail -5
3.To capture only lines bet 5-10 from /etc/passwd
 head -10 /etc/passwd | tail -5
4.To capture the 1st occurance of spool word from /etc/passwd file
  grep spool /etc/passwd | head -1
5.To capture the 3rd occurance of spool word /etc/paaswd file
 grep spool /etc/passwd | head -3 | tail -1

Changing permissions on files and floders
========================================
This can be done using chmod command and it is performed in 2 ways
1.using numerical notaion
read - 4
write - 2
execute - 1
 To give all permissions to user,group and others
	chmod 777 file1

 To give all permissions to user,read and execute to group and no permissions to others
	chmod 750 file2

 To recursively give permissions to files and subfolder present in a directory
	chmod -R 777 dir_name

2.using alphabetical notation
 Permissions can also be changed using alphabetical notation
owner  -    u
group -     g
others   - o

read  -r
write  - w
execute - x

+   is used for adding permissions
- is used for subtracting permsiions
= is used for assigning permissions
To add excute permissions to owner,remove write to group on file1
chmod u+x,g-w file1

To remove read permissions to owner,assign only write and execute to group and remove read for others and add execute for others
chmod u-r,g=wx,o-r+x file2

Creating users
===================
adduser username
To check the user info
cat /etc/passwd
